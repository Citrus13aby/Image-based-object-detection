# Image-based-object-detection
First YOLOV3 Image based object detection model 

Please check out my first image based object detection model. I am newbie to ML and AI from textbook learning and through surfing multiple github repo 
and with some correctional help I have produced this. I appreciate any and all feedback and any guidance on what steps I could to enhance my knowledge
in this field. 


Please do note that you would havel to switch out the names under the (image_path) for the respective .jpg files.
